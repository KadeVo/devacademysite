                <h1>What I Intend to do</h1>
                <p>My learning plan for the foundation is to dedicate time each day to learn a small chunk of the
                    content.
                    Afterwards, I will self-reflect and review what I have done in the day to ensure it sticks with me.
                </p>
                <p>Each day, I track what I do and how long I have studied using an Excel spreadsheet. I input the time
                    I
                    started, the time I stopped, what content I studied, and how satisfied I am with my progress.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I have been reflecting on previous work I have done throughout college and my own
                    self-study so I can further progress my understanding of computer science. I have started
                    watching ComSci lectures just to understand better.</p>
                <p>One issue I may face is either burnout or it becoming too difficult that I will lose motivation.
                    This why
                    I am trying to stay ontop of everything so everything won't become so difficult that I will lose
                    motivation to continue.
                    I have identified that I need to take appropriate breaks and be easy on myself as I am switching
                    careers
                    however, I am naturally just hard on myself so it is something I need to work on.</p>
                <p>There are a few skills I want to develop while at DevAcademy. I want to really work on my
                    teamwork and
                    communication skills as I know it is a core part of software development. I have studied and
                    graduated
                    with a bachelors of marketing
                    which is primarily group work. However, because of COVID-19 I am a lot worse than I would like
                    to be as
                    the online learning resulted in more solo projects. I can still communicate well and work in
                    teams but I
                    believe it is something I can always be better at.</p>
                <p> In regards to workload, I believe I am
                    currently managing fine. I have no current responsibilities and can focus on learning the
                    content within
                    the
                    week. I imagine the workload will increase whwich is why I need to stay more committed to my
                    dedicated
                    hours
                    of studying to reduce the possibility of burnout. I have been managing well due to my Excel
                    spreadsheet
                    that
                    keeps me accountable and keeps me grounded for expectations. Additionally, I have great friends
                    that can
                    help reduce my stress and keep my mind off things that are bothering me! </p>
                <p> I would like as much feedback as possible from the Facilitation Team. I am very open-minded and
                    will
                    take in any criticism. I know I am not the best at this nor am I even close to being good which
                    is why I
                    am happy to take in any feedback. So far I have noticed great help from the facilitators and
                    expect it
                    to stay that way with the great staff.</p>

                <h2>Revised Learning Plan</h2>
                <p>After doing the foundations I realised what my long term goals are. It is to land a job within a
                    software development company and work alongside developers, solving problems and coding for a
                    living. It may sound dull but whilst doing foundations and working with people to get something
                    done, it has shown me a level of cooperation within an industry which I have never experienced
                    before and would love to have in my every day life. Additionally, I have discovered that I am
                    limited to my mentality which will be my biggest limitation going into bootcamp, self-doubt, stress,
                    burnout are things I know I can potentially face in the upcoming bootcamp. Although something I
                    realised was a strength of mine was determination. Everyday although I am stressed, I continue to
                    push forward to ensure I do well and achieve what I want out of this course. Both will be apparent
                    in the bootcamp and I hope to use my limitations to fuel my strength. I believe another issue I may
                    face which is not technical will be focusing 9-5 for 5 days. Being at home there can be a lot of
                    distractions and if something is hard, it is very easy to look the other way and get my mind off it.
                </p><br>
                <p> I believe I expect a lot of support from the bootcamp team. I have met a few and have some
                    interactions with the staff. I know they are nice, genuine and caring people so I expect that they
                    will be very understanding and helpful. Whether that support comes in the form of demonstrating
                    examples of code, supportive words or giving an ear to listen to my stress/worries. I know a lot of
                    the staff will help out in any way they can. But with expectations of myself, I will work hard after
                    the bootcamp to educate myself on the days content to stay ahead or catch up if needed. I do not
                    have a lot of responsibilities at this time and will dedicate my downtime to staying on top of the
                    work or giving myself the tools to keep up with the workload. I know breaks are important so I will
                    dedicate multiple half an hour study sessions after the days work to give myself a break and let my
                    mind rest so I can continuouslaly improve. This should help relieve stress and allow me to
                    communicate my needs to other students and facilitators. </p>
