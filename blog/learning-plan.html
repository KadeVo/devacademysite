                <p>My learning plan for the foundation is to dedicate time each day to learn a small chunk of the
                    content.
                    Afterwards, I will self-reflect and review what I have done in the day to ensure it sticks with me.
                </p>
                <p>Each day, I track what I do and how long I have studied using an Excel spreadsheet. I input the time
                    I
                    started, the time I stopped, what content I studied, and how satisfied I am with my progress.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I have been reflecting on previous work I have done throughout college and my own
                    self-study so I can further progress my understanding of computer science. I have started
                    watching ComSci lectures just to understand better.</p>
                <p>One issue I may face is either burnout or it becoming too difficult that I will lose motivation.
                    This why
                    I am trying to stay ontop of everything so everything won't become so difficult that I will lose
                    motivation to continue.
                    I have identified that I need to take appropriate breaks and be easy on myself as I am switching
                    careers
                    however, I am naturally just hard on myself so it is something I need to work on.</p>
                <p>There are a few skills I want to develop while at DevAcademy. I want to really work on my
                    teamwork and
                    communication skills as I know it is a core part of software development. I have studied and
                    graduated
                    with a bachelors of marketing
                    which is primarily group work. However, because of COVID-19 I am a lot worse than I would like
                    to be as
                    the online learning resulted in more solo projects. I can still communicate well and work in
                    teams but I
                    believe it is something I can always be better at.</p>
                <p> In regards to workload, I believe I am
                    currently managing fine. I have no current responsibilities and can focus on learning the
                    content within
                    the
                    week. I imagine the workload will increase whwich is why I need to stay more committed to my
                    dedicated
                    hours
                    of studying to reduce the possibility of burnout. I have been managing well due to my Excel
                    spreadsheet
                    that
                    keeps me accountable and keeps me grounded for expectations. Additionally, I have great friends
                    that can
                    help reduce my stress and keep my mind off things that are bothering me! </p>
                <p> I would like as much feedback as possible from the Facilitation Team. I am very open-minded and
                    will
                    take in any criticism. I know I am not the best at this nor am I even close to being good which
                    is why I
                    am happy to take in any feedback. So far I have noticed great help from the facilitators and
                    expect it
                    to stay that way with the great staff.</p>
