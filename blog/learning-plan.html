<h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
    </div>
<div class="box">
<p>My learning plan for the foundation is to dedicate time each day to learn a small chunk of the content. Afterwards I will self-reflect and review what I have done in the day to ensure it sticks with me. </p>
<p>Each day, I track what I do and how long I have studied using an Excel spreadsheet. I input the time I started, the time I stopped, what content I studied and how satisfied I am with my progress.</p>
    <p>Addtionall, I have beenn reflecting on previous work I have done throughout college and my own self-study so I can further progress my understanding of computer science. I have started watching ComSci lectures just to understand better.</p>
