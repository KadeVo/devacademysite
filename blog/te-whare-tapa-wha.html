                    <h2>What is Te Whare Tapa Wha?</h2>
                    <p>Te Whare Tapa Wh훮 is a model of the 4 dimensions of wellbeing developed by T훮 Mason Durie
                        in 1984 to provide a M훮ori perspective on health. The 4 dimensions are Taha Tinana, Taha Whanau,
                        Taha
                        Hinengaro and, Taha Wairua. The 4 dimensions have a foundation named Whenua (land).</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing) - This refers to how our body feels and how we take care of
                            it.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <li>Taha Wh훮nau (Family Wellbeing) - This refers to who makes you feel like you belong, who
                            cares
                            about you and who you share your life with. Whanau is about your extended relationships,
                            those
                            who are in your friend groups, communities and the people you care about have a unique role
                            and
                            contribute to your wellbeing and identity.</li> <br><br>
                        <li>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing) - This refers to your mind, heart and

                            differently
                            depending on perspective as it can also contain elements of faith/religion. Essentially
                            wairua
                            is an internal connection to the universe that can widely be perceived.</li> <br><br>

                            of belonging, meaning a space where you feel comfortable and safe to be yourself. It
                            includes
