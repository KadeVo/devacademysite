                <h3>10 November 2010</h3>

                <p>
                    Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on his peoples enemies. One
                    morning
                    his
                    mother wanted kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te
                    Kao, a
                    short
                    distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare the hangi.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some
                    Te
                    Rarawa
                    people who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing
                    the
                    journey
                    over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi
                    to
                    heat
                    up
                    properly. On reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the
                    sweet
                    potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted stealing the kai (food). He was
                    immediately
                    recognised.
