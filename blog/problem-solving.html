                    <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
                    <p>A problem I encountered was through the Javascript Katas, specially the builtin-methods section.
                        The "whereAreyou" exercise had me a little stumped due to how the .find method works. It was a
                        unique concept to me that inside the .find method, you input a whole new function which was not
                        apparent to me. I had to Google to try reinforce my understanding of the concept however, I felt
                        as if I did not fully understand it. I then used Chatgpt to explain it better which did help
                        however, I felt it was best to hear it from a person.I contacted my facilitator (DavID) and got
                        him to explain to me the .find method and answer any questions I had. Throughout the learning
                        process I did feel frustrated as I figured that I should not have this much trouble
                        understanding just a method and felt stressed as bootcamp is coming up, it made me feel like I
                        am not ready or able to do this. I learnt that DavID is a great guy and helped me understand the
                        .find method more clearly. He explained how the "=>" is useful here and explained how
                        Object.values and .includes work thoroughly.
                    </p><br>
                    <h2>Elegantly Problem Solving</h2>
                    <p>During the fizzbuzz exercise where if you input a number, if it is divisible by 15 the computer
                        will say "FizzBuzz", if it is divisible by 5 it will say "Buzz" and if it is divisible by 3 it
                        will say "Fizz". Throughout this exercise I used Pseudocode to begin my code and began
                        console.logging, Googling and reading error messages as I was having numbers divisible by 15
                        returning "Buzz" which is the indication that it is divisible by 5. I learnt that order matters
                        as it is the process in which the computer will check for conditions. I had 5 the first order so
                        even if the number was divisible by 15, it has already checked off that it is divisible by 5,
                        making it so the computer never checks if it is divisible by 15.</p>

                    <h2>Problem Solving Processes</h2>
                    <p>Below states each problem-solving technique/process and how confident I feel in using them.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pseudocode: I am confident in using it however, I do not feel as if I am the best at writing
                            it out as some concepts still feel foreign to me and I might not write down that makes sense
                            or is applicable to the scenario.</li>
                        <br><br>
                        <li>Trying something: This method used to be my go to as I would try something new to possibly
                            get a new result or solution but may not fully understand it. It works with simplier
                            problems however, not reliable for complex issues.</li><br><br>
                        <li>Rubber ducky method: I am confident in this method as this is something I practice a lot by
                            myself as a general rule. I like to talk out when I do things to make sure it all makes
                            sense to me otherwise I might get lost in the coding process. I also explain my thoughts and
                            how I understand code to DavID which has made me more confident in my understanding of code.
                        </li><br><br>
                        <li>Reading error messages: This is something I am not entirely confident in as when I read the
                            error messages, sometimes I do not fully understand the error. However, reading "undefined"
                            errors are more simple than complex errors. Therefore, I find reading error messages useful
                            but not completely as some of the text feels foreign to me. </li><br><br>
                        <li>Console.logging: I am getting more confident with console.logging as I recently found out an
                            easy way to utilize the console.log in just a javascript file. Beforehand I would have to
                            have an html page to be able to check.</li><br><br>
                        <li>Googling: Googling has been my best tool as I believe every solution is on the internet,
                            however, as things become more complicated I can imagine it being increasingly more
                            difficult to find the help I am seeking on Google.</li><br><br>
                        <li>Asking peers ofr help: I have asked help from 1 peer which is who I am comfortable with.
                            However, new people I might not be so confidnet in asking for their help.</li><br><br>
                        <li>Asking coaches for help: I am confident in asking for help. I frequently meet up with DavID
                            a few times a week to help my understanding of concepts which has been a big help. However,
                            I have not talked to any other facilitators yet.</li><br><br>
                        <li>Improving my process with relfection: Reflection is something I frequently do to make sure I
                            fully understand the content I am digesting so I am confident in my ability to reflect.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <h2>Reluctant to ask for help</h2>
                    <p>I am reluctant to ask for help on more core knowledge because I feel as if I should know it and
                        feel worse than I should for not understanding the concept. One thing I still struggle with that
                        I have not asked for help yet is confidence. This is a non-technical issue I struggle with but
                        as challenges become increasingly more difficult as I feel as if I cannot do the work without
                        aid, my confident and my belief in my ability to do well in the bootcamp drops. I might consider
                        talking to someone about my feelings next time I feel this way. </p>
