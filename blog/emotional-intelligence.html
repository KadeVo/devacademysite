                <p id=" center">Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is primarily the ability to manage ones own feelings so that
                    their feelings
                    are expressed appropriately and effectively. Addtionally, EI contains analysis skills in which the
                    invidiual is self-aware of their feelings in regards of how it impacts them and those around them
                    and
                    empathetic towards others which flows onto good social/relationship management.</p>

                <p>Emotional Intelligence is different from IQ (Intelligence quotient) is that EI measures one ability
                    to
                    recognize emotions within yourself and others and utilizing that awareness to make decisions. IQ is
                    a
                    measurement that analyzes one ability to solve problems, use logic and grasp/communicate complex
                    ideas.
                    A linkedin article states that it is believed that IQ accounts for only 20% of someones success in
                    life
                    whereas the other 80% is determined by ones EI and social intelligence. This showcases how important
                    it
                    is to have developed EI. It enables the individual to regulate their emotions and understand their
                    friends & colleages better. A higher EI allows the person to build strong relationships, reduce
                    stress
                    in themselves & others and defuse conflict.</p>
