            <p>The purpose of this blog is for it to be like my playground where I test code and reflect
                back on it. This page will contain the content of the following topic: What is the difference between
                Margin, Border, and Padding?</p>

            <h2>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Margin:</strong> Margins are the transparent spaces around an element, outside of its
                    border. They create space between the element and its neighboring elements. Margins do not have a
                    background color or content and are used for visual separation or to control the positioning of
                    elements. Margin values can be set in CSS to specify the amount of space desired around an element.
                    <br>
                    <div class="example-margin">Example Margin</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Border:</strong> The border is a visible line or area that surrounds an element, enclosing
                    its content and padding. It is located immediately outside the margin. Borders can be customized in
                    terms of thickness, style, and color using CSS properties. They provide a visual distinction between
                    the element and its surroundings.
                    <br>
                    <div class="example-border">Example Border</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Padding:</strong> Padding refers to the space between the content of an element and its
                    border. It is the area inside the border and outside the content. Padding is used to create space
                    between the content and the border, allowing for breathing room and separation. Padding values can
                    also be defined using CSS, allowing you to specify the amount of space desired around the content.
                    <br>
                    <div class="example-padding">Example Padding</div>
                </li>
            </ul>
