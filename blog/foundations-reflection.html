                    <h2>3 Things I learnt about myself</h2>
                    <p>
                        I learnt how much I want to become a software developer, some goals and some weaknesses about
                        myself. What made me realise how much I want to become a software developer is when I completed
                        more javascript exercises. Doing these exercises, talking to people about them and working
                        together to solve issues made me realize how much I wanted this than I had known before.
                        Throughout doing them, I found out my goal is to find a company/group of people where I can work
                        in a team environment and create/solve things all day. This became a goal because I found out
                        how fun it is and would love for it to be my everyday life. However, one weakness I realized was
                        that I compare myself to others and make myself feel worse when I do not fully understand things
                        or can write the code that I envision. This is important as it is something that will be a daily
                        part of my life in the bootcamp and need to work on.
                    </p><br>
                    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Self-awareness is an important role to learning as knowing your own strengths and weaknesses are
                        essential to moving forward towards a goal. If I don't know my own strengths and weaknesses it
                        can take a lot longer to learn and interpret things. I struggle a lot with reading condensed
                        areas of writing and have to find other ways to digest the content. Knowing this and acting on
                        it is vital towards my success on learning anything. Values & empathy holds a role in learning
                        as it helps taking the right deicisions in situations in learning. It is even more important in
                        group learning as I will be working with people and having good and strong values will improve
                        my relationship and connection with my peers & teachers in my learning experience.

                    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
                    <p>
                        I think what surprised me the most about the core learning was what I learnt about myself. The
                        core learning was something I never really gave much thought outside of this course and was
                        never something I had previously explorered on my own or ever had to. Having to explore these
                        areas and learning about myself was surprising.
                    </p><br>

                    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
                    <p>
                        I think the most challenging aspect of the core learning was thinking like a programmer,
                        identifying my values and strengths. It is something I have never thought about before and
                        having to think about it was a challenge as I had to dig deep to get some answers. And thinking
                        like a programmer is a way of thinking that is completely foreign to me as prior I graduated
                        with a Bachelors of Business so they way of thinking is drastically different.
                    </p><br>
                    <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning
                        in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
                    <p>
                        I think the use of focusing on core learning helped me become more confident in myself and
                        understand how I behave and think. Knowing yourself inside and out is an advantage when taking
                        on a new intense learning experience as I know I will be facing new difficulties and stress.
                        Knowing how to deal with them, how I respond, what I need and being self aware will help me
                        throughout these potential future struggles.
                    </p><br>

                    <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have
                        just used that time to practise programming instead? </h2>
                    <p>
                        It does not feel like a waste of time as it wsa a learning experience about myself and is
                        useful information I can use for myself in future scenarios. The course taught me essential
                        knowledge about coding but even more valuable information about myself which I would have not
                        discovered anywhere else. I could have watched tutorials on Youtube or gone to another course
                        and would not have discovered these new areas about myself.
