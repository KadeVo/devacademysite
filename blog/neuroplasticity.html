            <h2 id="center">What is Neuroplasticity?</h2>
            <p class="center">The brain is constantly rewiring itself and modifying its connection. Neuroplasticity
                develops our brain allowing us to learn, and form memories. Essentially, its the ability to change and
                adapt due to experience. Without Neuroplasiticty our brains would not develop from infancy through to
                adulthood. At birth, every neuron in the cerebral cortex has an estimated 2,500 synapses, or small gaps
                between neurons where nerve impulses are relayed. By the age of three, this number has grown to around
                15,000 synapses per neuron. However, the average adult only has about half that number of synapses. This
                is because as we gain new
                experiences, some connections are strengthened while others are eliminated. This process is known as
                synaptic pruning. Things we hardly use eventually die, alloiwng our brain to learn or experience new
                things and purge the ones we have no use for. Neuroplasticity also facilitates the process of memory
                formation and retention. Through repeated practice and reinforcement, connections between neurons become
                stronger, making it easier to recall information or perform learned tasks. This is important in learning
                as it allow us to learn new
                things and the ability to enhance existing cognitive capabilities. Research has shown that sleep is an
                important role to the growth in the brain. It strengthens the brain and can encourage greater brain
                plasticity. Understanding neuroplasticity is relevant to learning because it highlights that the brain
                is not fixed or limited in its capacity to acquire new knowledge. It emphasizes the importance of
                continuous learning, practice, and exposure to new experiences to promote brain development and enhance
                cognitive abilities. </p>

            <h2 id="center">Growth Mindset</h2>
            <p class="center">Growth mindset is a concept developed by psychologist Carol Dweck, which describes the
                belief that intelligence, abilities, and skills can be developed through dedication, effort, and hard
                work. It is the belief that one's abilities are not fixed traits but can be improved and expanded over
                time. It believes tht if people struggle with something, it is not solidified that they can improve over
                time. There are 5 characteristics of Growth Mindset. Intellignece can be developed, Embrace Challenges,
                Persist in the face of setbacks, Seeing effort as a path to mastery, and Learn from criticism. All of
                these characteristics are a positive view-point on learning that we as humans can utilize to further
                develop whatever we are passionate about.</p>>
            <p> This is not something that is surprising to me as I always believed hard work and effort outweighs pure
                talent. This mindset is something I have been utilizing within my learning plan as I ask for constant
                feedback, put in a lot of effort and, persist through the challenges. I have hit many roadblocks and
                still keep going as I am determinded to continue my path in programming and find a job within this
                field.</p>
