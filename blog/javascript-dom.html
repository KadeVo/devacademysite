                <h2 id="center">What is Javascript?</h2>
                <p id=" center">Javascript is a programming language that gived functionality to HTML & CSS. It
                    is a
                    dynamic
                    program
                    that can update content, animate images, calculate, manipulate data, and allows the website
                    to be
                    interactive. An analogy that can be used for Javascript and its relationship to HTML & CSS
                    is the
                    structure of a house. HTML acts as the foundation and overall structure of the house & CSS
                    acts as
                    the
                    fancy paint, colours and every visbile feature. Javascript acts on the inside of the house,
                    wether
                    it be
                    electricity, plumbing, functional features such as outlets & faucets. As you can see by the
                    picture
                    below, Javascript completely enables the features of the house. Doors knobs, lights, a
                    fireplace,
                    these
                    all are things that Javascript would make work in the HTML & CSS relationship.

                <h2 id="center">Control flow & Loops</h2>
                <p> Control flow is the sequence of steps/decisions that determines the overall flow of a
                    process.
                    To demonstrate control flow, I will use an example of someone going out to order food that
                    is not
                    close
                    to home.
                <ol>
                    <li>Check what food you want to eat</li><br>
                    <li>If the place you want to eat at is open, go to the next step. If not, search for an
                        alternative.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Get in Car, if there is enough gas, go to the next step. Otherwise get gas.</li><br>
                    <li>Drive to destination.</li><br>
                    <li>Once at destination, park the car in restaurant parking lot. If no spots are available
                        park in
                        an
                        alternative street.</li><br>
                    <li>Enter restaurant</li><br>
                    <li>Order food</li><br>
                    <li>Once food has arrived, enjoy the meal!</li>
                </ol>

                <br>
                <h2 id="center">What is the DOM?</h2>
                <p>
                    The DOM stands for Document Object Model, essentially it is a tree structure due to each
                    node, there
                    is
                    an object that branches off to another object, hence the tree structure. The DOM enables a
                    user to
                    interact and access with objects within the HTML document, with Javascript, you can
                    manipulate HTML
                    &
                    CSS elements on a page. Below is an example of how the DOM structure features tree-like
                    aspects.
                    Everything at the top of my page section of "Javascript Fundamentals" to my "EQ & IQ" link
                    would
                    originate from the same branch. Whereas everything from "What is Javascript?" to now would
                    originate
                    from a different branch.
                <p>An example of someone manipulating the DOM is when you do online shopping. If you were to add
                    something
                    to your cart, that is Javascript manipulating the data and your webbrowser to store that you
                    have +1
                    item and will register it within their system. This is unique to your own cart and enables
                    you to
                    buy
                    what you want as it is automatically updated.</p>

                <h2 id="center">The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
                <h3>Arrays:</h3>
                <p>An array is stored in brackets [ ]. It looks like a box and it is best to imagine it
                    represents a
                    box.
                    Anything inside an array is in the same box so a primary example is imagine if you are
                    moving. You
                    have
                    a box for toys, electronics, decorations, fragile etc.. Each of these boxes store their own
                    items so
                    you
                    can imagine each box is a unique array. The first item that gets put in the box can be
                    considered
                    item
                    0, and the next one 1, then 2, then 3 and so on. Computers are just funny and begin at 0
                    which is
                    why
                    the first item is considered 0 and goes up by 1 increment from there. To access each item we
                    would
                    call
                    the posistion of each item, so if we wanted the very first item in the box we would enter
                    array[0],
                    or
                    if we wanted the second one it would be array[1].

                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Objects:</h3>
                <p>An object is represented by { } brackets. Objects essentially has properties that are
                    important to
                    the
                    object such as first name, last name, age and hair color. If you wanted to access the data
                    of the
                    object
                    from below, you would do person1.age which would contain the string of "23", if you wanted
                    to change
                    it
                    to a number and perhaps the information was wrong, the user could input person1.age = 24;
                    which
                    would
                    access the person1's age and change it to 24.

                </p>
                <br>
                <h2 id="center">What are functions and why are they helpful?</h2>
                <p>Functions contain aspects which enable something to happen. An example would be like a
                    recipe. Inside
                    the
                    function, you have your ingredients and you have to follow the recipe to make a cake.
                    However, you
                    cannot start from just anywhere when making a cake, you have to start at step 1. That is
                    what
                    functions
                    do. They start from the top and make their way down in order to make something happen. This
                    is
                    useful as
                    if you made 1 cake you would have to make it again. However, with Javascript because you
                    already
                    have
                    made the function to make a cake, all you would have to do is call it one more time and it
                    would
                    already
                    have the cake made for you!</p>
