            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>According to the 16personalities test, I am an INFP-A (Mediator). My strengths include empathy,
                generosity,
                open-mindedness, creativity, passion, and idealism. I believe these strengths will support me during my
                journey as being passionate and idealistic will keep me grounded and striving to further improve myself
                within this forever developing scene.</p>

            <h2>Culture and Values</h2>
            <p>The biggest influential figures in my life are my mother and father. As a child, I was very obedient and
                absorbed whatever they taught me, for better or for worse. I have developed strong values in family,
                friendship, hard work, integrity, and freedom.</p>
            <p>My father's Vietnamese culture had a significant impact on me and shaped my character as they embody the
                values my parents taught me. An example showcasing my identity is within the workplace. I once had
                managerial responsibilities and often resolved conflicts. I did my best to bring everyone together to
                discuss their feelings and get their perspectives known so we could build a mutual understanding of
                everyone's side.</p>
            <p>I knew my coworkers personally, and I understood that if I got them to communicate clearly, the issue
                would be able to be resolved between them, and it worked wonders. If I had to employ any other strategy,
                I would consider talking to them one-on-one and getting them to understand that personal matters should
                be kept out of work and strive to keep it strictly professional in the workplace.</p>
            <p>I believe this situation showcases my values as I value their friendship, hard work, integrity, and their
                freedom to resolve the conflict by themselves without my excessive involvement, enabling the best
                environment within the workplace.</p>

            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            <p>I believe a limitation on myself in terms of my learning and career development will be the potential
                burnout I may face. The constant grind of the course and my own study may exhaust me. I need to learn to
                not stress myself and give myself a break, as I may begin to feel like I am not doing enough when the
                workload becomes more difficult.</p>
