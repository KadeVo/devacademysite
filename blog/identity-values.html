<h1>My Identity Values</h1>
    </div>
<div class="box">
    <h2> Personality</h2>
<p>According to the 16personalities test, I am a INFP-A (Mediator). My strenghts would include empathy, generousity, open-mindedness, creativity, passion and, idealistic. I believe these strenghts will support me during my journey
as being passionate, and idealistic will keep me grounded and striving to further improve myself within this forever developing scene.</p>
    <h2> Culture and values</h2>
<p>The biggest influential figures in my life are my mother and father. As a child, I was very obedient and took in whatever they taught for better or for worse. I have developed very strong values in family, friendship, hardwork, integrity and, freedom. </p>
    <p>My fathers Vietnamese culture had a big impact on me and shaped my character as they all embody the values my parents taught me. An example showcasing my identity is within the workplace. I once had managerial responsibilites and often resolved conflict. I did my best to bring everyone together to discuss their feels and get their perspective known so we can build a mutual understanding of everyones side. </p>
    <p> I knew my coworkers personally, and I understood that If I get them to clearly communicate, the issue would be able to be resolved between them and it worked wonders. If I had to do any other strategy, I would consider talking to them one on one and get them to understand that personal matters should be kept out of work and try keep it strictly professional at the workplace.</p>
    <p>I believe this situation showcases my values as I value their friendship, hardwork, integrity and their own freedom to not result into any other decision and give them the option to talk to each other and solve it by themselves without me personally getting too involved and enabling the best within the workplace.</p>
    <h2> Limitations</h2>
    <p> I believe a limitation on myself in terms of my learning and career development will be the potential burnout I will face. I believe I will face burnout as the constant grind of the course with my own study will exhaust me. I need to learn to not stress myself and give myself a break as I will begin to feel like I am not doing enough when the workload gets more difficult. </p>
